# Junteng Liu

First-year PhD candidate at [HKUST NLP Group](https://nlp.hkust.edu.hk/), Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). My research focuses on natural language processing and machine learning, with particular interests in LLM reasoning and reinforcement learning, hallucination in vision-language models, and LLM truthfulness and interpretability.

## Research Interests

- **LLM Reasoning and Reinforcement Learning**: Exploring methods to enhance logical reasoning capabilities of large language models through synthetic data and reinforcement learning.
- **Hallucination in Vision-Language Models (VLM)**: Investigating perception bottlenecks and developing techniques to mitigate hallucination in chart understanding and multimodal tasks.
- **LLM Truthfulness and Interpretability**: Studying internal representations of truthfulness and developing interpretability tools to improve model reliability.

## Education

- **Ph.D. in Computer Science** (2024–Present)  
  Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)  
  Advisor: [Professor Junxian He](https://nlp.hkust.edu.hk/people/junxian-he)

- **B.Eng.** (2020–2024)  
  Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)  
  Graduated with honors; recipient of Zhiyuan Honor Scholarship.

## Experience

- **Research Intern**, MINIMAX (February 2025 – Present)  
  Working on large language models and reasoning.

- **Research Intern**, Tencent WXG (June 2024 – September 2024)
